    <h2>Minimalism at its Finest - Living in a Minimal World</h2>

      <div class="text"><strong>Minimalism</strong> is the art of less is more!!! Many believe that minimalism is the way to go and would die for the cause.</div>

        <blockquote>
          "I love <strong>minimalist</strong> websites. They are my pride and joy. I genuinely cannot look at websites that have more than two fonts; I think it's immoral." - Doug Johnson

      <div class="text">For instance, there is an organization that is trying to make cluttered websites illegal in Canada. They call themselves Alliance for Minimalist Websites or AMW for short and want to push for minimalist website standards. Some of their policies include:</div>
      <ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <li>
        No more than two typefaces per webpage
      </li>
      <li>
        Dual colour schemes
      </li>
      <li>
        Only lines for shapes
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    <div class="text">AMW have been ridiculed by critics of minimalism. The President for the Institution on Shutting Down Minimalism (ISDM) was very insistant on this,</div>
  </p>
  <p>
    <blockquote>
      "It's time that <strong>minimalists</strong> stopped telling us what to do with our websites. We have free will to design however we see fit, and if they can't understand the basic human right to freedom, they do not deserve respect."
    </blockquote>
  </p>
    <p>
      <div class="text">In conclusion, minimalism is not only a mode of design for the web developer. It is a lifestyle choice. Once you get into minimalism, there is no turning back. If you would like to donate to the <strong>minimalist</strong> cause and fight cluttered websites, please call the number 1-800-MIN-IMAL, or 1-800-646-4625.
